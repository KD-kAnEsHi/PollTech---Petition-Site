# PolTech 
This project aims to boost voter turnout by offering a user-friendly website with unbiased info on elections, candidates, and voting requirements. It targets young adults and low-income families, providing interactive tools and reminders to empower informed decision-making.

 - This Website is the first iteration of the PollTech site, without the use of React or any no backend
 - This project mainly focuses on the petition aspect of the site and serves as a stepping stone for the fully-fledged PollTech site
